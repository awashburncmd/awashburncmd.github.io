    <p class="about-us-p">Pink Fury Volleyball was founded by Hannah Kirkendoll and Ava Kramer with a shared passion for helping others discover and enjoy volleyball. Both Hannah and Ava have played many years of club volleyball, and began playing together their freshman year, where they became best friends. After graduating high school, they started coaching at the YMCA.
        <br> They continud coaching at the YMCA for over a year, working with kids aged 8-10, they have seen firsthand how dedication and skill-building can set young athletes up for success. <br>Many players from those early teams went on to join club volleyball, excelling in the sport.

        In addition to their experience at the YMCA, they currently coach the 13U Diamond team<br>at Midwest Shock Volleyball Club. Their goal is to inspire players to develop confidence, improve their skills, and foster a lifelong love of the game.</p>
